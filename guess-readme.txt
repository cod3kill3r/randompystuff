this is a simple number guessing game, which uses a random function to generate a random number within a given range
The game is designed in such a way as to allow an user to guess the number within the given number of tries.
Also, the game is interactive i.e. if the guess is higher than the number, the program tells the user to make a guess lower than the current number and vice-versa.
The game is over when the user is unable to guess the number after the number of tries is over.
